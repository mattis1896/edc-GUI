# CSS Folder

The **"css"** folder contains stylesheets responsible for the design and layout of various classes and pages within the project. These stylesheets define how elements such as text, buttons, images, and more are displayed.

### Key Features:
- **Flexibility**: By using these stylesheets, all elements within the GUI are easily customizable and adaptable.
- **Separation of Concerns**: The appearance of the page is controlled entirely within the stylesheets, meaning there is no need to modify the HTML structure for design adjustments.

### Common Classes:
There are several classes that are consistently used across all pages. These include:
- **Headings**: Standardized styling for headings throughout the pages.
- **Containers**: Classes used to define and separate different sections or areas of the page.
- **Buttons**: Unified design for buttons to maintain a consistent look and feel across the application.

By centralizing the design within the CSS, we ensure a clean, maintainable, and efficient approach to styling the entire project.
