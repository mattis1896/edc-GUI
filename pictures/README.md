# Pictures Folder

The **"pictures"** folder is used to store image files required for the design and layout of the GUI.

Currently, it contains the following images:
- **WAGO Logo**: Used for branding and identification within the GUI.
- **Icon**: An additional graphical element used in the interface design.

These image assets are essential for ensuring the visual elements of the GUI are properly displayed and aligned with the projectâ€™s branding requirements.
