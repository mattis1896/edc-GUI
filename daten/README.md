# Daten Folder

The **"daten"** folder contains simulated measurement series that represent the data expected from the Provider in the actual system. These measurement series consist of **timestamps** and corresponding **values**.

### Key Features:
- **Simulated Data**: The folder provides simulated measurement data, which mirrors the structure and format of the data that will later be provided by the actual Provider.
- **Simplified Development & Testing**: This simulated data is crucial for developing and testing the data exchange functionality without needing to read real-time values from the PFC (Platform for Communication).
  
By using these pre-generated data sets, developers can focus on coding the exchange logic and ensuring the system works as expected before integrating with real data sources.
