# HTML Folder

The **"html"** folder contains the HTML files that define the basic structure of the GUI. These files establish the layout and various static elements of the page, such as the header and body.

### Key Features:
- **Layout Definition**: The HTML files define the fundamental layout of the GUI, ensuring that the content is presented in a clear and organized manner.
- **Static Elements**: Elements like the header and body are statically programmed to create a consistent structure across the application.
- **Dynamic Elements**: Where necessary, dynamic elements are generated through **JavaScript** files, ensuring that the GUI remains flexible and adaptable without unnecessary static code.

These HTML files form the foundation upon which the GUI is built, providing a stable and structured base while allowing for dynamic content creation through JavaScript.
